Changes
=======

In next release...

- When a persistent object is first created, its state is local (even
  as its ``__init__`` method, if defined by a subclass, is called).

- Implemented method to create a snapshot of particular moment in an
  existing database.

- Added ``PersistentDict`` class. Due to changes in the ``Persistent``
  superclass, this dictionary is little more than sugar coating to
  implement the standard dictionary interface.

- The ``Persistent`` class is now persisted as changesets rather than
  complete object state.

- Set up tests to run using the nose testrunner (or using setuptools).

0.1 (2009-09-26)
----------------

- Initial public release.
